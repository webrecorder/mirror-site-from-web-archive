# Web Archive to Site

This template provides a starter to host web archives replacing a previously hosted on another (or same) domain.

Compared to regular web archive setup, this replaces a site, including links at original locations.

Currently, this only works for single site to be replaced.

### Usage

Fill in a path to WACZ file and the origin of the site to be replayed from the WACZ in init.js

```js
init(<path to WACZ>, <origin of site to replay>);
```
